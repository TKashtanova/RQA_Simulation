***Project Summary***

In this project, we implemented a quality assurance method for radiation therapy allowing to verify dose deposition in a medium externally and with no extra dose, using scattered x-ray registration. First, using the gDPM simulation package, we obtained the coordinates, momentum direction and energy of the photons scattered outside of a phantom after a MV x-ray beam passed through it. Then, using MATLAB, we collimated the scattered photons and registered them on a photon counting detector sensor. Finally, we related the recorded detector signal to the delivered radiation dose and analyzed the method feasibility. The procedures were carried out on both homogeneous and heterogeneous phantoms.
